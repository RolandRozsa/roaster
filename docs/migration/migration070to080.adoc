= 0.7.0 -> 0.8.0

== What's new

A new module has been created: *roaster-jaxrs*.
Its main objective is to provide solutions using JAX-RS specifications for needs that *roaster-restassured* cannot meet.
For example, it handles multipart handling and leverages the capabilities of *microprofile-rest-client*, which can fulfill many customization needs.
The *roaster-jaxrs* module has been accompanied by documentation titled <<Jaxrs>> and a testsuite.

== Changes

=== General
* The `hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.common.util.FileUtil` has been enhanced with `InputStream` reading parameters, and it handles error management within the function itself.

==== BOM version upgrades
* coffee v1.8.0 -> https://i-cell-mobilsoft-open-source.github.io/coffee/#_v1_9_0_v1_10_0[v1.10.2]
* deltaspike 1.9.1 -> 1.9.6 

=== roaster-restassured
* The `HealthCheckTestHelper` has been modified to support typed probe calls in addition to the general `/health` endpoint call.
- `/health/ready`
- `/health/live`
- `/health/started`
* The new *roaster-jaxrs* module has been integrated as a dependency due to shared configuration and usage (common classes). This causes minor changes in the Java path access.

=== Migration
The change requires minor adjustments, specifically the following Java paths have been updated:

* hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*restassured*.response.producer.ManagedResponseProcessorConfig -> hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*jaxrs*.response.producer.ManagedResponseProcessorConfig
* hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*restassured*.response.producer.ResponseProcessorConfig -> hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*jaxrs*.response.producer.ResponseProcessorConfig
* hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*restassured*.response.producer.RestProcessor -> hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.*jaxrs*.response.producer.RestProcessor

Otherwise, there are no operational changes; everything else remains unchanged and backwards compatible.

=== roaster-redis
The update to Coff:ee caused a change in the `hu.icellmobilsoft.roaster.redis.RedisHandler` class (`RedisService` was deprecated in Coffee).
The migration caused minor changes where method return types are now `Optional` instead of the previous `String` or `void`.

=== Migration
The change may require minor adjustments to return value types, otherwise it remains backward compatible.
