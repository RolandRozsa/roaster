= 0.9.0 -> 0.10.0

== Changes

=== roaster-tm4j

* Possibility to specify different TM4J test cycles per test member using the `roaster.tm4j.cycle.{0}` config key
* exception due to sharing with `roaster-restassured` module fixed

=== Migration
The changes will not result in any migration work, it is backwards compatible.

=== JDK 17 support
The project now supports java 17,
so it can be used in a java-based project like this.
Most of the problematic parts were fixed by dependency updates and javadoc extensions.

.java 11
The roaster will still be compiled with java 11,
but also get compilation and testing checks for java 17.
This will minimise the java version's discrepancy problems.

==== BOM version elevations:
* `org.jboss.weld:weld-junit5` 2.0.1.Final -> 2.0.2.Final
* `org.jboss.weld:weld-core-impl` 3.1.5.Final -> 3.1.9.Final
* `io.smallrye.config` 2.0.2 -> 2.13.0
* `com.google.guava:guava` 30.1.1jre -> 31.1jre (the selenide version used is no longer compatible with the old one)
