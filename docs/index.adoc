= Roaster testsuite documentation

The goal of the project is to assist developer testing using RestAssured + Weld + JUnit 5.

Benefits:

* Java basics, a simple and familiar environment for developers.
* The DTO classes generated by the project can be used.
** It is not necessary to manually assemble the request XML/JSON body.
** Keeping tests in an active state.
* Runnable from an IDE or via Maven on the console and CI tools.

Disadvantages:

* Requires a more complicated test structure at first.
